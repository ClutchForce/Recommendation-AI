## Installation Instructions

To use the `RecomendationAi` application, please follow these steps:

1. **Download the Executable and Data File**:
   - Download `RecomendationAi.exe` and `grocery_sells.csv` from the repository.

2. **Place Files in the Same Folder**:
   - Ensure both files are placed in the same directory/folder on your computer.

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Open the folder containing these files and double-click on `RecomendationAi.exe` to run the application.

Please make sure that both files are in the same location, as the application needs the `grocery_sells.csv` file to function correctly.
